## Overview

**Strikethrough** is one of the many formatting options available within Markdown. It is typically used to denote a selection of text that should be deleted or crossed out. It is indicated by wrapping the desired text with `~~`.

## Example Syntax

```text
~~~This text is using strikethrough~~ and this text is not.
```

```html
<p><del>~This text is using strikethrough</del> and this text is not.</p>
```
