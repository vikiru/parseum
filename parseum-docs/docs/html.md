## Overview

**HTML Tag** refers to elements within the **HyperText Markup Language (HTML)** such as `<p>`, `<h1>`, etc.

At present, all HTML tags are not rendered by the parser, but are captured accordingly.

## Example Syntax

```text
<p>This is a paragraph element using HTML. </p>

This is a paragraph element using Markdown.
```

```html
<p>This is a paragraph element using Markdown.</p>
```
