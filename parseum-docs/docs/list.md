## Overview

A **list** is an element that is typically used to group related content together. Lists come in two main forms `unordered` and `ordered` lists.

`Unordered` lists are denoted by a `-` and `ordered` lists are denoted by a number followed by a decimal and a space (i.e. `1.`).

## Example Syntax

### Unordered List

```text
- This is an unordered list item
- This is an unordered list item 2
```

```html
<ul>
    <li>This is an unordered list item</li>
    <li>This is an unordered list item 2</li>
</ul>
```

### Ordered List

```text
1. This is an ordered list item
2. This is an ordered list item 2
```

```html
<ol>
    <li>This is an ordered list item</li>
    <li>This is an ordered list item 2</li>
</ol>
```
