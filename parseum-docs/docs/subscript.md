title: Subscript
---

## Overview

**Subscript** is one of the many formatting options available within Markdown, although typically not supported by most parsers. It is typically used to denote a selection of text that should be rendered visually different from other text.

Subscript text is usually smaller and aligned vertically lower compared to other text. Subscript text is denoted by wrapping the desired text with `~`.

## Example Syntax

```text
This text is not using a subscript, but this ~text~ is.
```

```html
<p>This text is not using a subscript, but this <sub>text</sub> is.</p>
```
