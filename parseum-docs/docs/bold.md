## Overview

**Bold** is one of the many formatting options available within Markdown. It is typically used to ensure that a selection of text stands out from the rest of the text. It is denoted by wrapping the desired text with `**`.

## Example Syntax

```text
**This text is bolded** and this text is not.
```

```html
<p><strong>This text is bolded</strong> and this text is not.</p>
```
