## Overview

A **comment** is an element not typically supported by many Markdown parsers, however the purpose is to provide a way for users to
add for example, explantory text to sections without impacting the rendered html.

## Example Syntax

```text
[comment1]: # This is a comment.

This is a normal paragraph element.
```

```html
<p>This is a normal paragraph element.</p>
```
