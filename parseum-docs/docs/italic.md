**Italic** is one of the many formatting options available within Markdown. It is typically used to ensure that a selection of text stands out from the rest of the text. It is denoted by wrapping the desired text with `*`.

## Example Syntax

```text
*This text is italic* and this text is not.
```

```html
<p><em>This text is italic</em> and this text is not.</p>
```
